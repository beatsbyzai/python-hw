### Assignment 1

This week we were asked to create a simple calculator. This was my process in doing so: Creating three input() variables, one to store the first number, second number and the operation. I turned the input for the two numbers into integers so they wouldn't be processed as strings. I used 3 conditionals to do the calculation, conditional on the input of the operation ( + or - or * ).  Then, I printed the outcome.
